there are 3 .c files -
1.parta.c (Enter the pid to get all the starting virt_Addr and corresponding PFN(if present))
2.partb.c (Enter the pid and the particular virt_Addr to get the corresponding physical addr and encoded info)
3.partc.c (avg,min,max with multithreading)

to run the parta.c -
$gcc parta.c
$sudo ./a.out {pid}

(where {pid} is the pid you wish to enter)

to run the partb.c -
$gcc partb.c
$sudo cat /proc/{pid}/maps
(choose a virt_addr from this)
$sudo ./a.out {pid} {virt_addr}

(where {pid} is the pid you wish to enter, and {virt_addr} is an address from proc/pid/maps)

to run the partc.c
$gcc partc.c -lpthread
$./a.out
Enter space separated ints and hit Enter
